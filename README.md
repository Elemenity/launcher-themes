# launcher-themes
This repository contains themes for the Elemenity Launcher.
The launcher is the main user interface for the Elemenity devices.

The launcher uses web technologies to control its design. This
allows users to easily customize the look and feel of their
devices. Make your devices your own.

## Browsing themes
All themes in this repository are viewable in our theme test tool
(coming soon).

## Creating a theme
To create your own theme, you can make a copy of the 'skeleton'
folder.

If you would like to share your theme with the rest of the community,
feel free to send us a pull request to add your theme to this repository.

## Brand new to CSS?
Modifying an existing theme is a great way to experiment while
learning CSS. After copying the skeleton theme, you can work through the
free tutorial provided by Mozilla at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps.
